## Introduction

As climate change and increasing agricultural demands exacerbate water insecurity throughout California, understanding which communities are disproportionately burdened by groundwater pollution is essential to distributing safe drinking water and water treatment technology equitably. Though over one million Californians lack access to safe drinking water annually, approximately half of failing drinking water systems are concentrated in small towns and unincorporated communities located throughout the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), an agricultural powerhouse which produces nearly one quarter of the nation's food table (Del Real, 2019). According to a report by the Safe Water Alliance, approximately 95% of San Joaquin Valley residents at least partially rely on groundwater pumped from private wells as a source of domestic water (MacLeod & Estelí Méndez-Barrientos, 2019). However, much of the groundwater in this region is laden with nitrates, arsenic, and other pollutants largely produced by the agricultural industry. Because groundwater monitoring data tends to be concentrated in more heavily populated areas of the SJV, the purpose of this project is to build models which can predict the concentration of four major pollutants, nitrate, arsenic, 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP), and uranium in groundwater wells which lack chemical monitoring data. After constructing three types of models (linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression) for each contaminant using features like land use classification, soil characteristics, and proximity to hazardous waste sites, we performed model selection using k-fold cross validation.  The optimal models were determined to be lasso regression for nitrate, uranium, and 1,2,3-TCP prediction and linear regression for uranium prediction with testing mean squared errors of 9363, 228, and 74, and 228, respectively. While our nitrate model produced both high training and testing error, low training error exhibited by our models for uranium, arsenic, and 1,2,3-TCP leads us to believe these models might be biased. Consequently, though we are not confident in our contaminant predictions for wells with incomplete chemical monitoring data, this model could be improved by incorporating features more strongly correlated with the target variables.

## Project Background

Spanning from the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to the Tehachapi Mountains, the SJV is home to roughly four million people, many of which reside in urban centers surrounded by farmland. Though the majority of the region's population is serviced by municipal water departments, private utilities, and special districts with formal water treatment schemes, tens of thousands of residents rely on contaminated groundwater from domestic wells for drinking water (Ayres et al., 2021). Some of the most prevalent contaminants include nitrate, arsenic, 1,2,3-trichloropropane (1,2,3-TCP), and uranium. Though arsenic and uranium are naturally occuring elements in California's Central Valley, nitrate pollution largely originates from the agricultural industry in the form of fertilizer and manure runoff and 1,2,3-TCP tends to leach into groundwater from industrial and hazardous waste sites. Because these pollutants can be acutely toxic when ingested, groundwater contamination has been a major public health threat since the early 1900's. 


In order to irrigate crops, groundwater has been pumped from aquifers underlying the SJV since the 1930's, causing the entire valley to subside significantly. Coupled with heavy fertilizer application and biased hazardous water facility placement, contaminants easily infiltrate the shallow water table where they can be transported to wells used for drinking water. Though lack of access to clean drinking water is a serious concern throughout the SJV, it is important to note that groundwater pollution is inequitably distributed to Black, Indigenous, and Latinx residents in Central California, particularly with regards to nitrate contamination (Balazs & Morello-Frosch, 2011). Looking more closely at the origins of drinking water disparities in Central California, we see that historical redlining of low-income and minorities communities has resulted disparate access to water treatment infrastructure; for instance, the 1973 Tulare County General Plan witheld "major public facilities such as sewer systems" from "nonviable" communities when developing the regions, continuously opting to expand into undeveloped agricultural parcels rather than connect their watter supply and treatment systems to nearby towns despite taxing these communities for public amenities they cannot access (Balazs & Morello-Frosch, 2011). While selective annexation is just one contributer to drinking water disparities in the SJV, it demonstrates how systemic racism can manifest in the form of environemental inequities. 


With approximately 3.5 billion dollars reserved for improving water infrastructure in California (Hubler, 2021), allocating drinking water treatment infrastructure equitably is essential to mitigating drinking water disparities in the SJV. Though several studies have modeled distributions of environmental risk in this region, a reoccuring issue is the lack of reliable data in rural and unincorporated communities, many of which are theorized to experience the highest exposures to groundwater pollution. CalEnviroScreen in particular has quantified drinking water security in the form of the metric 'drinking water percentile,' a conglomerate metric which describes a community's relative vulnerability to water scarcity and contamination. While this metric takes groundwater pollution into account, it interpolates contaminant concentrations in wells without chemical monitoring data by averaging measurements in nearby wells (Ziese & Blumenfeld, 2021). This modeling strategy can be effective for wells in close proximity to one another, but is less effective for remote wells. Created in hopes of improving upon the drinking water disparity quantifications by other organizations, this project utilizes machine learning to predict contaminant concentrations in groundwater wells with insufficient chemical monitoring data.

## Project Objective
  
Originally inspired by CalEnviroScreen's predictions for drinking water percentile, the objective of this project is to train and evaluate four models capable of predicting nitrate, arsenic, 1,2,3-Trichloropropane, and uranium concentrations in groundwater wells with incomplete groundwater monitoring data for the year 2019. Motived by a lack of complete groundwater monitoring data in rural and unincorporated communities in the SJV, the goal of this project is to create models which can predict concentrations of major pollutants in data-sparse areas. However, because the majority of the data used to train our models is sourced from urban wells in the SVJ, there is a risk of an external validity issue for predicting groundwater pollution in rural wells. Though groundwater pollution is just one aspect of water security in California, we hope that our models can contribute to a more accurate depiction of environmental risk distributions in the Central Valley and help policy makers advocate for more equitable allocation of clean water and water treatment technologies.
